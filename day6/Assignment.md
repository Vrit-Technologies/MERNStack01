# Assignment DAY 6
1) FizzBuzz Problem
```
Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

Example 
input 3
output
["1","2","Fizz"]
HINT: loop from 1 to n(input)
check if the current element is divisible by 3, by 5 and by 3 and 5 based on that push either FizzBuzz/fizz/buzz on the array
```

2) 
```
Make a function that takes in input as 
[1,2,'Sushil',1,2,'Sushil','Sushil'] or any arbitrary array as an input.
The function should count the occurence of each item in array and return a object with the count
Example
Input
[1,2,'Sushil',1,2,'Sushil','Sushil']
Output
[{input :1, count : 2}, {input : 2, count : 2}, {input : 'Sushil', count : 3}]
```
